# TodoItems List

An Android exercise for developers teaching how to play around with RecyclerView and Adapter

## Background:

In this project, we are creating a TODO list app.
The user can insert TodoItems, mark them as DONE or IN-PROGRESS, and delete them.

The exact SPECS can be found at file `MainActivity.java`.

*NOTICE:*
The app implementation is extracted into logic and UI:

Pure-logic should be implemented at `TodoItemsDataBaseImpl.java`.

UI should be implemented at `MainActivity.java`.  

## To fulfill this exercise:

Take a look at the following files, read all of them, and make sure you understand them before starting to write any code:
* `TodoItemsDataBase.java` (interface)
* `TodoItemsDataBaseImpl.java` (default implementation of the interface)
* `TodoItem` (data class representing a TODO item)
* `MainActivity.java` (screen)

After you understand them, go ahead and implement the needed SPECS as defined in `MainActivity`.

> ðŸ›ˆ **NOTICE:** \
> You might need to modify classes, add fields, change methods etc etc.  
> Don't be afraid, it's completely ok to modify existing code.

## Tests:

*Logic tests:*
You are expected to add unit & flow tests to `TodoItemsHolderImplTest.java`.
Read the entire file and then implement the TODOs in that file. 

*UI tests:*
You are expected to add a few tests to `MainActivityTest.java`.
Read the entire file and then implement the TODOs in that file.

## Remarks:

Tests implementations should come *last*. Start with logic tests and then continue to UI tests. 
My request to write tests is only an added-value for you to sharp your testing skills.
If you see that the exercise takes too much time to implement even *without* writing the tests,
please **LET ME KNOW** and I will drop the request for tests from the exercise submission.
